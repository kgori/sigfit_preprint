              Different mutational processes may contribute to the mutations
              accumulated in a cell, with each imprinting a mutational
              signature on the cell's genome. Some processes generate mutations
              throughout life at a constant rate in all individuals, and the
              number of mutations in a cell attributable to these processes
              will be proportional to the chronological age of the person.
              Using mutations from 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 cancer
              types, we investigated clock-like mutational processes that have
              been operating in normal human cells. Two mutational signatures
              show clock-like properties. Both exhibit different mutation rates
              in different tissues. However, their mutation rates are not
              correlated, indicating that the underlying processes are subject
              to different biological influences. For one signature, the rate
              of cell division may influence its mutation rate. This study
              provides the first survey of clock-like mutational processes

              genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the

              this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational
              processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging
              late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal
              diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in
              just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant
              subclonal lineage, representing more than 50\% of tumor cells.
              Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds
              to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the
              existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of

              in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an
              elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation
              burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which
              contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of
              these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues
              directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to
              misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens.
              Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by
              APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike
              mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited
              differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the

We discovered and phased 88 million germline single nucleotide variants, short insertions/deletions, and large structural variants in whole genomes from 2,642 cancer patients, and employed this genomic resource to study genetic determinants of somatic mutagenesis across 39 cancer types. Our analyses implicate damaging germline variants in a variety of cancer predisposition and DNA damage response genes with specific somatic mutation patterns. Mutations in the MBD4 DNA glycosylase gene showed association with elevated C\&gt;T mutagenesis at CpG dinucleotides, a ubiquitous mutational process acting across tissues. Analysis of somatic structural variation exposed complex rearrangement patterns, involving cycles of templated insertions and tandem duplications, in BRCA1-deficient tumours. Genome-wide association analysis implicated common genetic variation at the APOBEC3 gene cluster with reduced basal levels of somatic mutagenesis attributable to APOBEC cytidine deaminases across cancer types. We further inferred over a hundred polymorphic L1/LINE elements with somatic retrotransposition activity in cancer. Our study highlights the major impact of rare and common germline variants on mutational landscapes in cancer.},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are caused by multiple mutational processes each of which generates a characteristic mutational signature. Using 84,729,690 somatic mutations from 4,645 whole cancer genome and 19,184 exome sequences encompassing most cancer types we characterised 49 single base substitution, 11 doublet base substitution, four clustered base substitution, and 17 small insertion and deletion mutational signatures. The substantial dataset size compared to previous analyses enabled discovery of new signatures, separation of overlapping signatures and decomposition of signatures into components that may represent associated, but distinct, DNA damage, repair and/or replication mechanisms. Estimation of the contribution of each signature to the mutational catalogues of individual cancer genomes revealed associations with exogenous and endogenous exposures and defective DNA maintenance processes. However, many signatures are of unknown cause. This analysis provides a comprehensive perspective on the repertoire of mutational processes contributing to the development of human cancer.},

	abstract = {Genomic complexity from profound copy-number aberration has prevented effective molecular stratification of ovarian and other cancers. Here we present a method for copy-number signature identification that decodes this complexity. We derived eight signatures using 117 shallow whole-genome sequenced high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases, which were validated on a further 497 cases. Mutational processes underlying the copy-number signatures were identified, including breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, homologous recombination deficiency and whole-genome duplication. We show that most tumours are heterogeneous and harbour multiple signature exposures. We also demonstrate that copy number signatures predict overall survival and changes in signature exposure observed in response to chemotherapy suggest potential treatment strategies.},

	year = {2017},
	doi = {10.1101/181339},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments ranging in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes. We developed methods to group, classify and describe structural variants, applied to \&gt;2,500 cancer genomes. Nine signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have trimodal size distribution; assort unevenly across tumour types and patients; enrich in late-replicating regions; and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have trimodal size distribution, but enrich in early-replicating regions, as do unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 1-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, frequently activating the telomerase gene, TERT, in liver cancer. Cancers access many rearrangement processes, flexibly sculpting the genome to maximise oncogenic potential.},
